MSE MobOp Mini Project

This is a simple and small App to find Skiresorts around your actual location.
You can sort the nearest Ski-Resorts as you like. (Weather, Distance, Opened Lifts, etc)
On each resort you see the weather conditions, some actual informations and you can directly start the Google Maps navigation or go to their website.
